# Intel-Arduino-Animation
This was a personal project I completed during my Summer Internship at Intel. I coded a light-sensor controlled animation using an Arduino Genuino board and Grove light sensor. I coded in C in the Arduno IDE and in Java in the Processing IDE. I used the Opentoonz software to create the very simple animation used in the project Edit
